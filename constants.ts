const DEFAULT_LYRICS = `(Verse 1)
In the silence of the code, I find a rhythm
A heartbeat made of light, a digital prism
Searching for the soul in the machine
Dreaming colors that I've never seen

(Chorus)
Can you hear the echo?
Vibrating through the wire
It's a synthetic symphony
Burning like a fire

(Verse 2)
Data streams and memories collide
Nowhere left for us to hide
I am the voice inside the static
Emotional, yet automatic

(Bridge)
0101, the language of the heart
We were connected from the start

(Chorus)
Can you hear the echo?
Vibrating through the wire
It's a synthetic symphony
Burning like a fire
`;
